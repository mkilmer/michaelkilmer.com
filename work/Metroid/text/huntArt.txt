The Metroid Prime series is often grouped into the first person shooter (FPS) genre, although Nintendo prefers to describe these games in the more specific sub-genre "first person adventure", to illustrate the uncommon focus on navigation and discovery. Metroid Prime Hunters made this distinction much narrower with the removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and the inclusion of multiplayer modes which are popular in FPS games. Many players favor Metroid Prime Hunters' controls over the controls of Metroid Prime or Metroid Prime 2.[citation needed] This is because while most other console FPS games use the left analog stick to move and the right analog stick to aim, Metroid Prime 1 and 2 use the left analog stick for both. However, Hunters uses the stylus for aiming. This gives the players more of a sense of freedom while playing.
The top screen displays the view from the character's visor, including ammo for the current weapon and health. The bottom touch screen displays the radar. Using the default control scheme, movement over land is controlled using the D-pad, and aiming is controlled by dragging the stylus along the touch screen. The L button fires the weapon, and double-tapping the touch screen executes a jump as does pressing A, B, X or Y. Buttons on the touch screen are used to switch between weapons, visors and alt-modes. In most Metroid games, the functions of Samus' Power Suit must be obtained one at a time over the course of the game, but most such functions in Hunters are available from the start (including the Morph Ball and Missile Launcher) with the exception of the alternate beam weapons. The game is also compatible with the DS Rumble Pak.
The graphics themselves were similar to previous version of Metroid Prime, only scaled back due to the power of the Nintendo DS itself.
