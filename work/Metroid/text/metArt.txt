Prior to the NES release, the game was released in Japan on the Famicom Disk System. Unlike the NES versions, this uses a three-slot save system (very similar to the save system used in the Legend of Zelda games) rather than lengthy passwords. In addition, as armorless Samus was a bonus feature added for the NES port, it was not included in the FDS version. The FDS version instead adds a money bag image to the save slot, which indicates a completed game.

The FDS version utilizes the system's wavetable sound channel for several sound effects, such as doors opening and larger monsters being hit. One other major sound change was to the "countdown alarm" when Mother Brain dies: in the FDS version, it's a loud screeching siren, and in the NES version, it's a slightly soft "whoop whoop" sound. Five song themes in the game also use the wavetable channel, adding an extra instrument to the music. In the NES version, this instrument was removed completely. The character initialization and item collection themes in most other Metroid titles were based on the themes from the FDS version of Metroid; however, Zero Mission uses a combination of both the FDS and NES music (with the exception of the "Planet Escape" theme, based on the FDS version, whereas the NES version was extended with a section of the song. The NES version is the one that is commonly remixed by fans of the games' music). It should be noted that there is a fan translation patch available that allows this version to be played in English.
