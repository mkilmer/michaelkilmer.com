Metroid Prime Hunters is a first-person shooter and adventure game for the Nintendo DS developed by NST, a Redmond-based first-party developer for Nintendo, and released on March 20, 2006.
Story
Chronologically, Metroid Prime Hunters takes place in the Metroid series after Metroid Prime and before Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. In the adventure mode, one plays as the primary bounty hunter Samus Aran. In the introduction to the game, Galactic Federation empaths receive a strange telepathic message stating that the key to the "ultimate power" resides in the Alimbic solar system. The Federation commissions Samus Aran, the renowned bounty hunter, to investigate and retrieve (or neutralize) this power. Despite the efforts of the Galactic Federation to encrypt the message, six other bounty hunters picked up the broadcast, proceeding to the system to claim the power as their own.
Upon arrival to the system, Samus finds that the Alimbic society has long since been destroyed. Investigating the two planets and two space stations orbiting the Alimbic sun, she gradually pieces together the history of the race.
The Alimbics were a peaceful, spiritual, highly evolved society. Eventually, the Alimbic utopia was shattered when a meteor struck, and out of it emerged a monstrous creature that they would name Gorea. Gorea copied the cellular structure of the Alimbics, physically mimicking them and their weapons, and destroyed their civilization.
The dying act of the Alimbics was to seal Gorea away until another could destroy it. The entire race transformed themselves into focused telepathic energy, then confined Gorea into a "Seal Sphere" which they placed in a Starship called the Oubliette. The ship was launched into a dimensional rift called the Infinity Void, to be released only when eight keys called "Octoliths" were assembled.
Warding off the competing bounty hunters, Samus retrieves the eight Octoliths from the powerful automated defenses (Cretaphid & Slench) in the Alimbic Cluster, and opens the Infinity Void. Here, she and the other six hunters confront Gorea, who originated the telepathic message in an attempt to free itself. The beast absorbs the powers of all of Samus' rivals. If Samus fulfills a prophecy by shooting switches in a specific order with specific weapons that match their color, Gorea's true form is revealed. Samus manages to defeat Gorea in the final showdown by using the Alimbic weapon called the "Omega Cannon." The Omega Cannon is the true "Ultimate Power" talked about throughout the whole game,not the Alimbuic Cannon. As she along with the other hunters evacuate the exploding Oubliette on their ships, three Alimbic spirits appear before a suitless Samus and honor her with a salute. However, if Samus fails to fulfill the prophecy, Oubliette will explode, but none of the hunters, including Samus, are seen escaping with their ships.
Hunters
* Samus Aran, the renowned bounty hunter, is the protagonist of the Metroid series. Samus was orphaned as a child, and bequeathed her Power Suit by her adoptive Chozo parents. A favored agent of the Galactic Federation, Samus is often called upon to complete missions that would otherwise be impossible. Samus' exploits include her clashes with the Space Pirates over their weapon of choice, the deadly Metroids. Samus can change into the Morph Ball, a compact sphere capable of dropping energy bombs. Her weapon of choice is the Missile Launcher, which can be made to home in on enemy hunters during combat.
* A lab experiment gone awry, Kanden is an insane and power-hungry alien of unclear origin. He searches for the secrets of the Alimbics to prove himself the strongest bounty hunter. Kanden can morph into the Stinglarva, a slug-like creature with the ability to drop a part of its tail behind, acting as a missile. His weapon of choice is the Volt Driver, an electrical weapon that is able to disrupt the enemy hunters' visors and distort their vision.
* Spire is the last of the Diamonts, a silicon based species. He believes finding the power of the Alimbics will help him solve the mystery of what happened to his own race, who have mysteriously died out. Because of his body's rocky composition, he takes no damage from lava. Spire morphs into the Dialanche, a slow boulder-like form covered in spikes, with the ability to climb walls and extend a pair of titanium battering rams. His weapon of choice is the Magmaul, which launches chunks of superheated magma. These latch on to enemies and burn them, causing prolonged damage.
* A Kriken of the despised Kriken Empire, Trace is undergoing his rite of passage into adulthood, during which he searches for a planet that the Krikens can invade, and ultimately conquer. He can transform into the Triskelion, a three-legged insectoid creature that attacks viciously by lunging forward and slashing anyone in his path with his razor sharp claws. Also, he cloaks in this form when he stays still. His weapon of choice is the Imperialist, a powerful sniper rifle with a scope. He turns nearly invisible using this item while standing still.
* Noxus is a Vhozon bounty hunter and something of an overzealous "law enforcer". He seeks the Alimbics' ultimate power in service of justice, and intends to keep it safe from evil hands and the unworthy. His alternate form is the Vhoscythe, a spinning top with an extendable blade that can be used to damage adversaries. Noxus' weapon of choice is the Judicator, which is a weapon somewhat similar to Samus's own Ice Beam, except that it is able to bounce off of walls. When charged, it freezes enemies for a brief amount of time.
* Little is known about Sylux except that he hates the Federation, and Samus Aran by association. His armor, equipment, and ship are all stolen Galactic Federation technology. He transforms into the Lockjaw, a small hovercraft that deploys bombs with electric tripwires. His weapon of choice is the Shock Coil, which rapidly drains energy from enemy hunters. In the 100% ending of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, a ship which is possibly the Delano 7, Sylux's ship, follows after Samus.
* Weavel, a Space Pirate general, was once left for dead by Samus after a battle on Brinstar. Only his brain and spinal cord remained intact, which the Space Pirates effectively attached to a mobile life support system and Weavel was reborn as a cyborg. It is unknown where his loyalties lie, though he remains with the Space Pirates as long as it suits his interests. Weavel changes into the Halfturret, in which his body splits in half. The upper body moves freely on its hands, attacking with a jumping, slashing move. The lower body remains stationary, acting as a self-sufficient gun turret. His health is shared between both halves of his body, leaving him very vulnerable in this state. His weapon of choice is the Battlehammer, a crude but effective rapid-fire weapon said to be quite popular among Space Pirates.
