As a remake of Metroid, Zero Mission's general layout is very similar to the original. However, many new items, areas, and mini bosses have been added, as well as an entirely new area near the end of the game. At first glance, it appears to be a linear game, forcing the player to acquire certain items in a certain order. However, careful exploration of the environment allows for the player to disregard a large part of this ordering. This technique has been termed sequence breaking and makes it possible, if very difficult, to finish the game collecting only 9% of the items. Progress can be saved in certain rooms, called, appropriately, "Save Rooms", or Samus's ship on Crateria. The save rooms are marked on the added in-game map with an "S", while Samus's ship is marked by an image of a ship.Zero Mission makes a strong departure from the series with the inclusion of an all-new gameplay sequence in which the player must control Samus without her powersuit. In this portion of the game, Samus is more vulnerable to damage, she must crawl through ducts on her hands and knees without the help of the Morph Ball power, and her only weapon is a weak pistol that can only stun an enemy for a brief moment. However, Samus retains all energy tanks she acquired previously, as well as the three new upgrades Ñ Gravity Suit, Space Jump and Plasma Beam. This marks the first time she has been playable during the course of normal gameplay without her suit Ñ in each previous Metroid game, seeing Samus without her armor has been a feature in one or more of the game's endings or a cosmetic Easter egg.
