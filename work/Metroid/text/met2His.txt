Metroid II: Return of Samus is the second title released in the Metroid series, and the only one to appear on the Nintendo Game Boy. Samus Aran returns in this sequel to the NES classic on a mission to exterminate the Metroids, now venturing to their home planet, SR-388. Although it is the second release in the franchise, chronologically it takes place after Metroid Prime 3: Corruption and before Super Metroid.
Story
Metroid II takes place an unspecified period of time after the first Metroid, in which bounty hunter Samus Aran defeated the Space Pirates on Zebes and their plans to use the newly-discovered lifeform known as the Metroid for evil purposes. To ensure this will not happen a second time, the Galactic Federation attempts to send teams to planet SR-388 to destroy the Metroids. When none of the teams survive, they contract Samus to handle the task.
During the course of gameplay, Samus hunts down and destroys each Metroid on the planet. As she does so, she takes note of the steady mutation that each goes through, mutations which cause them to grow from small jellyfish-like creatures into massive, hovering lizard-like beasts.
At the game's climax, Samus fights a final battle against the Metroid Queen. After defeating it, Samus begins to make her way to her ship. On the way, she happens upon a Metroid egg which hatches before her eyes. A tiny little Metroid hatchling floats out of the broken shell and imprints onto Samus as its mother. Unable to commit to her genocidal mission, Samus spares its life. The two continue exiting the tunnels, and the Metroid hatchling helps Samus escape the caverns. Samus and the young Metroid board the gunship and this ends the game.
