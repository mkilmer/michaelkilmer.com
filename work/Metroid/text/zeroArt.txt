Most of the music in Zero Mission consists of orchestral arrangements of Hirokazu "Hip" Tanaka's soundtrack from the NES version of Metroid. The game also borrows tracks from Super Metroid and includes a few pieces that are completely new to the series, such as the mother ship music. Zero Mission's soundtrack was produced by Minako Hamano and Kenji Yamamoto, who also composed music for Super Metroid and Metroid Prime, respectively.

A style resembling hand-drawn comic book panels pervades the game's backgrounds, as well as the cinematic cutscenes that appear infrequently throughout the story. Alpha blending is used extensively throughout the game; opaque foreground elements which obscure hidden areas will smoothly fade away once the player finds the entrance.

This game is on most occasions referred to as the better looking of the two Metroid games current available for Game Boy Advance. Many believe Zero Mission is graphically superior because Fusion was one of the first releases for the system - conversely, the developers (like others) were not sure exactly how much the system could handle. The graphics, nevertheless, still look quite similar. Samus, however, is noticeably more detailed in Zero Mission.
