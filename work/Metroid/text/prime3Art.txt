Metroid Prime 3:Courruption is the third and last game of the Metroid Prime Series, the graphics are similar to those of the previous Gamecube titles, however with the upgraded horsepower of the Wii system we see crisper textures and overall a higher degree of polish.
Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is also the first game in the Metroid series in which the game characters utilize full voice acting, although previous games in the series used limited voice acting to varying degrees. Most notable of the actors is the inclusion of Chris Sabat, best-known as the voice of Vegeta and Piccolo in Dragon Ball Z, as the hunter Rundas.
The game also plays out more like a shooter than previous games that relied heavily on adventurous aspects. This however does not hinder the fun that the game is.
