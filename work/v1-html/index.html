   		<h1> Updates</h1>
    <p> <b>04/04/09</b> - So I have been pretty busy as of late. I haven't updated this site in quite awhile. Back in November I had a job lined up and it fell through so I took a job as a Manager at Gamestop to earn a little money and keep myself busy. I have been there for like 6 months and was continuing to look for a new job. I just got a job working for Davis Advertising in Worcester as a Jr. Web Developer. I am still going to be working at Gamestop part time for only a few days a month. I start my new job in a couple of days. I decided that I should probably update my website and hence here I am. I have also started working on a 3d Model of a Frog, eventually it will be posted up here once I finish him. That's all for now.</p>
